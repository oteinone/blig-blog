Recently I've noticed that I have to deal with a lot of abstract matters at work that do not have clear-cut correct answers. I also find that these issues need some processing and I've not found a better way than writing about them yet.

This blog is an attempt to build a better mental model (and with that better intuition) by organizing my thoughts on leadership in a software development organization in a shareable format (public blog).
