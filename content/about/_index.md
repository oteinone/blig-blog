Welcome to my personal (but very professional) blog! This is where I catalog my thoughts and catalog work issues.

I a an engineering manager (CTO) working and living in Finland. I've been engineering for ~20 years and manageering ~10 years. I don't have much of a footprint on the internet so there are very few places to link to. Check [my Linkedin](https://fi.linkedin.com/in/otto-teinonen) if you wish.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog was created as a way to catalog and publish reflections about my working life as an engineering manager.

I'll probably write about various topics that interest me, including:

- Engineering management & leadership
- Technology and programming
- Organization and process development
- Learning experiences
- Let's be honest probably also "this is how I blog" type meta articles

I find that I deal with more and more abstract management issues at work and I've found writing to be the best way to organize my thoughts. This blog allows me to store and share these musings.

All thoughts are likely stolen from someone smarter than me but none represent my employer(s).
