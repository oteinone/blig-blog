Welcome to my personal (but very professional) blog! This is where I catalog my thoughts and catalog work issues.

I a an engineering manager (CTO) working and living in Finland. I've been engineering for ~20 years and manageering ~10 years.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog was created as a way to catalog and publish reflections about my working life as an engineering manager.

I'll probably write about various topics that interest me, including:

- Engineering management & leadership
- Technology and programming
- Organization and process development
- Learning experiences
- Let's be honest probably also "this is how I blog" type meta articles
